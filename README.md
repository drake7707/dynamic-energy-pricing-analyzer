## Dynamic energy pricing analyzer

Download the BELPEX historical data and an export of the quarter data from Fluvius, then load them and you can analyze your usage/production pattern as well as the historical BELPEX behaviour.

The totals are calculated based on the BELPEX hourly price as well as the given formulas for consumption and production. As each energy supplier has a different formula for a markup you'll have to adjust that, that way you can compare which energy suppliers are the cheapest (though don't forget to take into account the fixed fees, which can be considerable)
